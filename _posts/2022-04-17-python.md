Now that you've learned a bit about Python, reflect upon and answer the following questions.

What are the primary uses for Python?
It seems that python is great for data interpretation/analysis, providing interactivity on webpages, and providing automation.   


What are some positives to using Python?
Python is fairly straightforward in the sense of it does explicitly what you tell it to do. It's easy to breakdown and understand if you know that the language is strictly built upon logic. It does not take a while to learn either. I'm certainly not proficient, but in only a little over a week I felt pretty comfortable with the majority of the functionality of the language. 

What are some downsides to using Python?
It can be difficult to read or understand what code inside of a project is actually being executed by python since it relies heavily upon indentation. The fact that it relies so much on indentation is nice for keeping things clean and concise, however if you need to edit some code for example in the middle of a project, knowing where you indentation is at is critical. It is easier to read and orient yourself in other languages, like JavaScript.
